    <h1>Pictures and Information about my Top Ten Locations</h1>
    <h2>1. Salamanca, Spain</h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>My favorite spot that I have ever traveled to is Spain. I went here in the summer of 2023 
        for a Study Aborad trip with UNA. I spent one month living with a host family and learning Spanish. 
        The best thing about this city is the infrustruce and culture. The streets are filled with friendly people
        and there is always lots of events going on in the main square. It is not close to being one of the most popular cities 
        in Spain. However, I think it is a must visit in if you are in the country.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Kailua, Hawaii</h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>This city is located on the beutiful island of Oahu. This city is home to the famous beach on Laniki Beach.
        This beach is quite large with clear water and two mokes in the distance that add greatly to the view compared to 
        other beaches on the island. It is out of the way of the capital city Honolulu which allows you to have a more
        quiet time.

    </p>
    <h2>3. New Orleans, Louisiana</h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>The culture of New Orleans is unmatched. The amount of history in this city is great for young and old to explore.
        I went here for spring break last year and had a great time seeing the city, learning about the culture, and hanging
        out on Burbon Street.
        
    </p>
    <h2>4. Nassua, Bahamas</h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>When I visited this city I stay in the Atlantis Resort. This resort is one of the best in the world. It has things
        to do for young and old. It has it own water parks and aquriams that will fill up much of your time when visiting.
