    <h1>Pictures and Information about my Top Ten Locations</h1>
    <h2>1. Salamanca, Spain</h2>
    <img src="../images/salamanca-cathedrals-1.jpg" alt="Spain">
    <p>My favorite spot that I have ever traveled to is Spain. I went here in the summer of 2023 
        for a Study Aborad trip with UNA. I spent one month living with a host family and learning Spanish. 
        The best thing about this city is the infrustruce and culture. The streets are filled with friendly people
        and there is always lots of events going on in the main square. It is not close to being one of the most popular cities 
        in Spain. However, I think it is a must visit in if you are in the country.
